# Affinity Designer to Spine

A script is not needed for Affinity Designer because it has exporting to Spine built-in! Affinity Photo can also do it.

To set it up click `Export Persona` then `Create slices`. On the `Slices` tab choose `Spine JSON`, check `Continuous` so they are exported again as soon as changes are made, then click `Export slices`.

Affinity Designer doesn't yet have support for [tags](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-scripts/tree/master/photoshop#tags) like the PhotoshopToSpine script, but Affinity has said they plan to add that soon.
